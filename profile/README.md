### [Deployed app](https://consultancy-fe-7544dba9595c.herokuapp.com/)

When you want to learn something new or get a refresher and keep your skills sharp
When the day got away from you and you'd still like to get some light studying in without opening your laptop or getting down a rabbit hole of notes or a full meal of lessons, have a snack!
